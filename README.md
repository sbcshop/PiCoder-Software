The PiCoder is loaded with many features that are going to help you learn and explore many opportunities in the field of computer science and electronics.

PiCoder is an all-in-one STEM learning kit that allows students to work directly with the most common hardware components used in DIY projects. 
Features the most well-known Raspberry Pi Pico, which enjoys strong community support.The most popular programming languages, Micropython, Ciruitpython, and Arduino, are supported across platforms.

Because the lesson for the PiCoder kit is mostly based on Micropython, it is advised that you understand the very fundamentals of Python.
This GitHub provides details and step-by-step instructions how to use PiCoder kit.

## Getting Started with PiCoder  
### 1. How to Install Boot Firmware in Pico W of PiCoder kit

- Mostly, Picoder will be provided with firmware pre-installed, so you can skip this step if firmware is already present and directly jump start programming by following the below Step 2.
- How to know whether firmware is already present in your PiCoder: for this, just connect your PiCoder to your laptop, and if no extra device is detected, that means your PiCoder has it.
- And if you connect the PiCoder to a laptop without pressing the boot button, if it shows mass storage device named as "RPI-RP2" like the one below, then the firmware is not installed.
  
   <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/RPI_folder.jpg" width="720" height="360"/>

- In this case, you need to add **MicroPython firmware** in PiCoder. First, you need to *Press and Hold* the boot button on pico W of PiCoder, and then, without releasing the button, connect it to PC/laptop using micro USB cable. Check below image for reference,
  
  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/ArdiPi_Software/blob/main/images/pico_bootmode.gif">

- Now your device is in boot mode, and you will see a new mass storage device named "RPI-RP2" as shown in the below figure.
  <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/RPI_folder.jpg" width="720" height="360"/>

- Download the MicroPython firmware file provided in this repo above as ["PiCoder_firmware.uf2"](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/PiCoder_firmware.uf2)
or to download the latest firmware file from the official site, [visit here](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/)     
     
- Drag and drop the MicroPython UF2 - ["PiCoder_firmware.uf2"](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/PiCoder_firmware.uf2) file provided in this github onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Your Pico W will reboot. You are now running MicroPython on PiCoder.

### 2. Running First Program in PiCoder
- Download **Thonny IDE** from [Download link](https://thonny.org/) as per your OS of PC/laptop and install into your system.

  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/thonny_IDE.png" width="463" height="388">

- Once done start **Thonny IDE application**, connect PiCoder kit with laptop/PC using micro usb cable.
  
- Download complete PiCoder software github and extract, so you can try example demo codes which is provided.

  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/download_picoder_github.png" width="342" height="239">
  
- Open any one example in Thonny IDE. Select device at the bottom right with a suitable COM port, as shown in the below figure. You might get a different COM port.

  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/img1_boardselect.png">
  
  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/img2_boardselect.png"> 

- If everything ok then you will get success message like as shown in below image, 
  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/Picoder_pico_connected.png">

- Before trying any example script make sure you have _**picoder.py**_ lib file present in PiCoder. If not, proceed to [step 3](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/tree/main#3-how-to-move-script-codes-or-any-files-to-picoder) to move the file within PiCoder's Pico.
  
- With Demo LED Blink code open in IDE, click on Green Play Button or F5 to run script code. 
  
  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/run_demo_script.png">

- This is solely useful for testing code before moving it to PiCoder. However, in order to run the script without an IDE, you must first move it to PiCoder. To accomplish this, proceed to [step 3](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/tree/main#3-how-to-move-script-codes-or-any-files-to-picoder) below.
  
### 3. How to Move Script Codes or Any Files to PiCoder

- Check that the file view is selected in Thonny IDE; if not, go to View > Files. This makes the computer and Pico folders visible.

  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/fileview_step.gif">

- Open code script you want to move, click File > Save a Copy > Select Raspberry. Now name of code script must be main.py and select yes to overwrite previous.

  <img src="https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/filetransfer.gif">

- While moving lib file don't rename, maintain original name picoder.py, alternative file transfer method if renaming is not necessary->
