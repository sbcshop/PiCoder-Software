The PiCoder is loaded with many features that are going to help you learn and explore many opportunities in the field of computer science and electronics.

## Getting Started with PiCoder  
### 1. How to install boot Firmware in Pico W of PiCoder kit

- Mostly, Picoder will be provided with firmware pre-installed, so you can skip this step if firmware is already present and directly jump start programming by following the below Step 2.
- How to know whether firmware is already present in your PiCoder: for this, just connect your PiCoder to your laptop, and if no extra device is detected, that means your PiCoder has it.
- And if you connect the PiCoder to a laptop without pressing the boot button, if it shows mass storage device named as "RPI-RP2" like the one below, then the firmware is not installed.

- In this case, you need to add **MicroPython firmware** in PiCoder. First, you need to *Press and Hold* the boot button on pico W of PiCoder, and then, without releasing the button, connect it to PC/laptop using micro USB cable. Check below image for reference,

- Now your device is in boot mode, and you will see a new mass storage device named "RPI-RP2" as shown in the below figure.

- Download the MicroPython firmware file provided in this repo above as ["PiCoder_firmware.uf2"](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/PiCoder_firmware.uf2)
or to download the latest firmware file from the official site, [visit here](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/)     
     
- Drag and drop the MicroPython UF2 - ["PiCoder_firmware.uf2"](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/PiCoder_firmware.uf2) file provided in this github onto the RPI-RP2 volume. Your Pico W will reboot. You are now running MicroPython on PiCoder.


### 2. Running First Program in PiCoder
- Download **Thonny IDE** from [Download link](https://thonny.org/) as per your OS of PC/laptop and install into your system.

- Once done start **Thonny IDE application**, connect PiCoder kit with laptop/PC using micro usb cable
  
    

Now you are ready to try out your own codes and build awesome projects with PiCoder, **_Happy Learning!_**
