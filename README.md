The PiCoder is loaded with many features that are going to help you learn and explore many opportunities in the field of computer science and electronics.

## Getting Started with PiCoder  
### 1. How to install boot Firmware in PiCoder kit

- Mostly, Picoder will be shipped with firmware pre-installed, so you can skip this step if firmware is already present and directly jump start programming by following the below Step 2.
- How to know whether firmware is already present in your PiCoder: for this, just connect your PiCoder to your laptop, and if no extra device is detected, that means your PiCoder has it.
- And if you connect the PiCoder to a laptop without pressing the boot button, if it shows a folder named "RPI-RP2" like the one below, then the firmware is not installed.

- In this case, you need to add **MicroPython firmware** in PiCoder. First,  you need to *Press and Hold* the boot button on PiCoder, and then, without releasing the button, connect it to the USB port of your PC/laptop.

- Now your device is in boot mode, and you will see a new device named "RPI-RP2" as shown in the below figure.

- Download the MicroPython firmware file provided in this repo above as ["firmware.uf2"](https://github.com/sbcshop/HackyPi-Software/blob/main/firmware.uf2)
or to download the latest firmware file from the official site, [visit here](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/)     
     
- Just copy and paste the firmware into the RPI-RP2 folder, and now the bootloader is properly installed inside the PiCoder. To verify remove device and re-insert into PC/Laptop, no need to press boot button. This time you will see a new device as RPI-RP2.


### 2. Running First Program in PiCoder
- Download **Thonny IDE** from [Download link](https://thonny.org/) as per your OS and installed.

- Once done start **Thonny IDE application**,
  - Connect PiCoder kit with laptop/PC using micro usb cable
  
  - After this go to Run -> Configure interpreter, choose device and suitable com port as shown in below images

    <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/img3.jpg" />
    
   - There is other option to select device at bottom right side as shown in below figure
     <img src= "https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/images/img4.jpg" />
   
   - Write simple python code and click on green run button to make your script running on PiCoder
