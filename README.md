## Getting Started with PiCoder  
### 1. How to configure PiCoder

Mostly Picoder will be shipped by installing firmware so you can skip this step if firmware already installed, and directly jump start for programming by following below steps 2
To add **MicroPython** firmware in PiCoder, For this first you need to *Press and Hold* the boot button on PiCoder, without releasing the button connect it to USB port of PC/laptop. 
Then you see a new device named "RPI-RP2" as shown in below fig.

Download the MicroPython firmware file provided in this repo above as ["firmware.uf2"](https://github.com/sbcshop/HackyPi-Software/blob/main/firmware.uf2)
Or to download latest firmware file from official site [visit here](https://micropython.org/download/rp2-pico-w/)     
     
Now at this step bootloader installed properly inside PiCoder. To verify remove device and re-insert into PC/Laptop, no need to press boot button. 
This time you will see a new device as shown in the below image:-
