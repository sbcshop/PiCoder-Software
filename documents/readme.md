## [PiCoder Library](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/picoder.py) : 

The [picoder.py](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/picoder.py) module is designed to make it simple to work with the various PiCoder onboard components. As a result, creating cool projects with the PiCoder kit takes less time because no specialised interface coding is required. This will help you to get start quickly.

Each onboard component is represented by the following essential Class in the module. There are also several supporting classes included in the module.


### (1) LED
LED class is used to control onboard two LEDs. You will have to pass parameters as a choice of LED 1 or 2. Else you can pass GPIO number of Pico W to which external LEDs are connected on the breadboard.
 
|Method | Function |
|---|---|
|_on_ | used to turn on LED |
|_off_ | used to turn off LED |

**Use case:**
```
# import required module from library
from picoder import LED

# interested to work with LED1
Led1 = LED(1)   # create class instance, by passing LED number
Led1.on() 	  # call function to turn on LED 1 of PiCoder
```
[Demo LED Example](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/examples/Demo_LED.py): this example on Github turns led on and off in a fixed interval of time.

### (2) BUZZER
BUZZER class is used to control the onboard buzzer. Includes a straightforward way for turning on and off a buzzer with a fixed tone.
No parameters required to pass if using an onboard buzzer. Pass GPIO number if using external buzzer.

|---|---|
|_on_ | used to turn on Buzzer |
|_off_ | used to turn off Buzzer |

**Use case:**
```
# import required module from library
from picoder import BUZZER

buz = BUZZER()   # create class instance
buz.on() 	      # call function to turn on buzzer
buz.off()	     # to turn off 
```
[Demo Buzzer Example](https://github.com/sbcshop/PiCoder-Software/blob/main/examples/Demo_Buzzer.py): this example on Github turns Buzzer on and off in a fixed interval of time.


### (3) BUZZERTONE
BUZZERTONE class is used to control the onboard buzzer, having the facility to create tones depending on Frequency of sound and you can control loudness.

|Method | Function |
|---|---|
|_play_ | to turn on Buzzer, this method needs frequency and loudness value as parameters |
|_stop_ | to turn off Buzzer |

**Use case:**
```
# import required module from library
from picoder import BUZZERTONE

buz = BUZZERTONE()   # create class instance
Freq = 1024          # change to see different tone
loudness = 2000      # Higher the louder, close to 0 reduce sound intensity
buz.play(freq, loudness)  # call function to on buzzer with some tone
buz.stop()	     # to turn off buzzer 
```
